    <p class="redbackground">Sometimes dipping your toes into the World of Real Ale can be a real daunting task. Do i only like a certain type of beer? Do i like multiple? Are all Ipa's the same? Which Brewer is best? Which Brewer is right for me? There are a million and one different questions you could find yourself pondering so here at BBR we have compiled a shortlist of our Favourite and reccomended Brewers.</p>

<h3>Top Rope</h3> <img src ="TopRopelogo2png.png" width="100"
<br>
<br>
<p class="redbackground">Our first Brewer is a fairly new brewer based in the city of Liverpool. Created by a pair of wrestling fanatics. Their brand is very clear. Aimed at those with a penchant for nostalgia and WWE. Top Rope are famous for basing thier beers around professsional wrestlers, from Papa Mango to Stone Cold Cream Austin to Tripel H. Any wrestling fans wil be able to notice the link. Theyre not solely about the puns however, their beers are high quality and they offer something for everyone.

<h3>Tiny Rebel</h3> <img src ="TinyRlogo.png" width="100" 
<br>
<br>
<p class="redbackground">Second on our list of Brewers for the new IPA drinker is Wales' very own Tiny Rebel. Established in 2012 by brothers in law Brad & Gareth. They created an instant classic in 'fubar' and have never looked back since. Famous for their colourful and quirks designs, 80s references and even more quirky beers. From Clwb Tropicana (who doesnt love a wham reference), to Stay Puft Marshmellow Porter to Pump up The Jam there really is something for everyone and we implore you to give them a try! </p>

<h3>Northern Monk</h3> <img src ="NMlogo.jpg" width="100"
<br>
<br>

<p class="redbackground">Our final recommendation is Leeds based power house Northern Monk. Although they are a releatively new brewery (established in 2013) they have quickly established themselves as one of the better known brewers in the UK, Beers such as Faith, Eternal, Northern Star and Origin have quickly become staple beers in any respectable IPA serving bar. </p>
