<h3>Top Rope - Papa Mango</h3> <img src ="papman.png" width="100">


<p class="redbackground"> Our first review of the month is one of our all time favourites from the lads over at Top Rop Brewing in Liverpool. It's a juicy, hazy mango pale ale, Papa Mango is dry hopped with Citra hops and then conditioned on 60kg of Alfonso mango puree. Think juicy mango overload with a soft hoppy finish. Remember Solero lolly ices when you were a child? think solero but in a glass, Yum!!!

<p class="redbackground">Next on the list is another big hit in the BryanRatesBeers office from our friends in Leeds. Faith by Northern monk. Faith is the brewers flag ship Ale and a must try for all new IPA drinkers. A Modern Hazy Pale Ale packed with soft fruit flavours. Fruity, refreshing and packs a little punch, perfect for a hot summers day</p>

<h3>Pineapple Express - Tiny Rebel</h3> <img src ="pinexpress.png" width="100">
<p class="redbackground">To complete our Summer trio we take a jaunt over to sunny Wales to visit our friends at Tiny Rebel. It will come as no surprise to anyone what this next one tastes like. Its a smooth tangy Pineapple IPA. Not the faint hearted this IPA comes in at %6.2. Its so packed with flavour however its hard to noice as it glides down your gullet as tho it contains nothing but fruit juice!</p>
